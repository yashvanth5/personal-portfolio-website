    <h3>A little bit about my background :-</h3>
    <p>My name is yashvanth , I am from Hyderabad and I completed my undergraduation in 2022 and now spending all my time to learn code  </p>

    <h2>My coding Journey so far :-</h2>
    <p>Two years ago, i had began to exploring different skills and interests. After trying out a few different things, i felt like being in the digital world it's super important to learn code and that's when i discovered my love towards coding and I decided that I have to master this.</p>
    <p> Earlier i did coding but i was not consistent but From past couple of months, i have been dedicated to learning as much as i can and now i learned the basics of several languages, including HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT and now i started to work on more advanced projects in order to expand my knowledge on languages more and more.</p>

    <p> In my coding journey i realized that it is not a smooth road. As i being a self-taught programmer , i gathered information on the technologies i need to know. I am careful to follow the correct technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. Despite the challenges i face, i remain committed to push myself to improve. As i gain more knowledge and experience,
         I am confident that i will be able to overcome any obstacles that come my way and i would to like to continuously learn and grow as a programmer and i am excited to learn even more and to continue to improve my skills.</p>
    
    <p class="quote b1"><b>A strong mindset can overcome any obstacle. Believe in yourself and you can achieve anything</b></p>

    <h3>Why I want to be in NeoG camp</h3>
    <p>My primary motivation for learning frontend/full stack development is to gain a deep understanding of this field. I believe that the best way to achieve this is to learn from industry experts who have a wealth of knowledge and experience. By studying under tanay i get to learn a lot and gain the skills and knowledge I need to master this field </p>
    <p>I am committed to putting in the time and effort necessary to achieve this goal and i would also get to learn together with aspiring web developers</p>
    <p>I started level zero on 20th November 2022 and finally completed it on 16th December 2022. This level zero journey taught me so much as i saw no one who is teaching depth's even in basic and it was fun and challenging and I am very excited to learn even more in levelOne as its going to be more tough and more challenging.</p>
    <p>I have a never give up attitude and i know it's just a matter of time it takes me to get good at it so if i be a neoG level one student it will raise my confidence to up to multiple folds and I am ready to give my 100% hard work and efforts to NeoG camp .</p>
    <p>I get to network with similar mindset people and it also allow me to collaborate on projects, share ideas, and build valuable connections with my peers. </p>
    <p>one thing which would help me specifically is it make's me good at interviews by going through mock interviews which are in neog-camp</p>
    <p>It focuses on practical, hands-on learning and gain real-world experience so it would help and i also get proper guidance and support from neog-camp </p>
