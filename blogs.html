        <h1>A blog on artificial intelligence</h1>
        <p>
          artificial intelligence in pop culture usually involve a pack of intelligent robots hell-bent on overthrowing
          the human race, or at least a fancy theme park. Sentient machines with general artificial intelligence don't
          yet exist, and they likely won't exist anytime soon, so we’re safe ... for now. 
          That's not to make light of AI's potential impact on our future. A 2021 Pew Research survey revealed that 37
          percent of respondents who are more concerned than excited about AI had concerns including job loss, privacy
          and AI’s potential to “surpass human skills.” Additionally, tech billionaire Elon Musk, long an advocate for
          the regulation of artificial intelligence, has called AI more dangerous than nukes.
          Despite these legitimate concerns, we're a long way from living in Westworld.

        <h1>A blog on blockchain technology</h1>

        <p>
          A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a
          database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for
          their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized
          record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a
          record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.
